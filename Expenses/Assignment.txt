For Wednesday develop a simple expense tracking spreadsheet with the following columns

	date
	purchaser (name of the person that bought the item)
	category (grocery, toiletry, lawn&garden, etc)
	item
	cost
	store (where you purchased it)

Add 15 - 20 rows of data and then create a summary of the total cost and average cost of all items. Use the SUMIF function to calculate The total for each category, and the SUMIF and COUNTIF functions to calculate the average for items purchased in a particular store.

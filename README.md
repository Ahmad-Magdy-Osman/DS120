Data Analysis and Machine Learning Models in Excel.

I took this class in Spring 2017. Each folder is its own project/exercise. There are some exercises in addition to multiple clustering, sentiment analysis, and linear regression models in this repository. The projects are all in excel and can be walked through easily. Feel free to clone this repository and to explore the projects.

Four Measures to find the Threshhold:
	1-Precision
	2-Specificity
	3-False Positive Rate
	4-Sensitivity/Recall/True Positive Rate

Precision
	#Predictions >= Threshold AND
		#Where Actual value is 1
			Divided by #predictions >= Threshold

Sensitivity(TPR; True Positive Rate)
	#Predictions >- Threshold AND
		#Where Actual Value = 1
			Divided by #Actual 1's

Specificity(TNR; True Negative Rate)
	#Predictions < Threshold AND
		#Where Actual value is 0
			Divided by #Actual 0's

FPR; False Positive Rate
	1 - TNR

People end up focusing on FPR and TPR

RCO Curve -> FPR and TPR

To find the threshold: When dealing with predicted data -> Find the Min and the Max
	Max - Min(number of points on the RCO curve you wanna get) -> (Max-Min)/100
		Start your threshold with min, the min+the calculated above, and increment by that on each cell. Cell 3: Min + 2((Max-Min)/100)
